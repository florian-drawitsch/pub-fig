### Rationale
Matlab's plotting libraries are extremely powerful, yet the default settings produce questionable figures in terms of readability and aesthetics.

Pubfig provides simple-to-use utilities through which Matlab figure- and axes handles can be passed, resulting in publication-quality figures within a wide range of common figure sizes - without the need to meticulously adjust multiple dozen figure and axes properties.

### Usage
The common usage pattern is illustrated in `/examples/pubfig_simple.m`, together with example plots.
